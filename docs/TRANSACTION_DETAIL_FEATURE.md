# Transaction Detail View Feature

## Overview

The Transaction Detail View provides operators and auditors with comprehensive information about payroll transactions while maintaining privacy protections and security standards.

## Features

### 1. **Detail Drawer Interface**
- **Slide-out drawer** opens from the right side of the screen
- **Scrollable content** for easy navigation of all transaction information
- **Responsive design** adapts to different screen sizes
- **Close mechanism** via overlay click, close button, or escape key

### 2. **Transaction Summary**
Displays high-level transaction information:
- Total amount paid (formatted with proper currency display)
- Number of employees paid
- Transaction ID (with copy functionality)
- Current verification status

### 3. **Timeline Information**
Shows key timestamps:
- **Created date/time**: When the transaction was initiated
- **Processed date/time**: When the transaction was verified/completed
- Formatted in human-readable format with both date and time

### 4. **Verification Status**
Comprehensive verification metadata:
- **Visual status indicators**: Icons and badges for verified/pending/failed states
- **Status descriptions**: Human-readable explanations of each status
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof**: 
  - Displayed with privacy controls (show/hide toggle)
  - Masked by default (shows first 12 and last 12 characters)
  - Copy to clipboard functionality
  - Full proof visible when requested

### 5. **Blockchain Details**
When available, shows:
- **Transaction hash**: Full blockchain transaction identifier
- **Copy functionality**: Quick copy to clipboard
- **Explorer link**: Direct link to Stellar Expert (opens in new tab)
- Properly formatted for readability

### 6. **Privacy Protection**
- **Sensitive values masked**: Individual salaries and personal data not exposed
- **Privacy notice**: Clear explanation of privacy protections
- **Aggregate data only**: Only totals and counts visible
- **ZK proof abstraction**: Technical details hidden by default

### 7. **Organization Information**
- Company/organization ID linked to the transaction
- Properly formatted and copyable

## User Interactions

### Opening the Detail View
Users can open transaction details in two ways:
1. **Click any table row** in the transaction history
2. **Click the "Details" button** in the actions column

### Viewing Sensitive Information
- ZK proofs are masked by default
- Click "Show" to reveal full proof
- Click "Hide" to mask again
- Copy button appears when proof is visible

### Copying Data
- Transaction hash can be copied with one click
- ZK proof can be copied when visible
- Visual feedback ("Copied!") confirms successful copy

### External Links
- "View on Explorer" opens Stellar Expert in new tab
- Links use proper security attributes (noopener, noreferrer)

## Security & Privacy Features

### 1. **Data Masking**
```typescript
const maskValue = (value: string, visibleChars = 8) => {
  if (value.length <= visibleChars * 2) return value;
  return `${value.slice(0, visibleChars)}...${value.slice(-visibleChars)}`;
};
```

### 2. **Progressive Disclosure**
- Sensitive information hidden by default
- User must explicitly request to view full details
- Clear visual indicators of privacy protection

### 3. **Privacy Notice**
Always displayed at bottom of drawer:
- Explains data protection measures
- Clarifies what information is encrypted
- Reassures users about privacy guarantees

## Component Architecture

### Main Components

#### `TransactionDetailDrawer`
**Location**: `components/features/transactions/TransactionDetailDrawer.tsx`

**Props**:
```typescript
interface TransactionDetailDrawerProps {
  transaction: PayrollTransaction | null;
  open: boolean;
  onOpenChange: (open: boolean) => void;
}
```

**State Management**:
- `showProof`: Controls ZK proof visibility
- `copiedField`: Tracks which field was recently copied

#### UI Components Used
- `Sheet`: Base drawer component (Radix UI Dialog)
- `Badge`: Status indicators
- `ScrollArea`: Scrollable content area
- Lucide icons for visual indicators

### Integration Points

#### `TransactionHistory` Component
Updated to include:
- Transaction selection state
- Drawer open/closed state
- Click handlers for opening details
- Hover effects on table rows
- Details button in actions column

## Technical Implementation

### Styling Approach
- **Tailwind CSS** for all styling
- **Consistent spacing**: 6-unit padding system
- **Color palette**: Gray scale with accent colors for status
- **Responsive breakpoints**: Mobile-first design

### Accessibility Features
- **ARIA labels** on all interactive elements
- **Screen reader support** via semantic HTML
- **Keyboard navigation** fully supported
- **Focus management** handled by Radix UI
- **Color contrast** meets WCAG AA standards

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy rendering**: Drawer content only renders when open
- **Memoization**: Date formatting cached
- **Efficient re-renders**: State updates isolated to drawer
- **No unnecessary API calls**: Uses existing transaction data

## Status Indicators

### Verified Status
- **Icon**: Green checkmark circle
- **Badge**: Green background with "Verified" text
- **Description**: "This transaction has been cryptographically verified and is immutable on the blockchain."

### Pending Status
- **Icon**: Yellow clock
- **Badge**: Yellow background with "Pending" text
- **Description**: "This transaction is awaiting verification. The zero-knowledge proof is being processed."

### Failed Status
- **Icon**: Red X circle
- **Badge**: Red background with "Failed" text
- **Description**: "This transaction failed verification. Please contact support if you believe this is an error."

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Drawer not opening**:
- Check that transaction data is loaded
- Verify onClick handlers are attached
- Check browser console for errors

**Copy not working**:
